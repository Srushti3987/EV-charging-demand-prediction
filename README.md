# EV Charging Demand Prediction

This project is part of the Green Skills AICTE Internship. It aims to analyze and predict EV charging demand patterns using real-world data.

## Week 1 Deliverables

- Dataset: EV Charging Station usage data
- Tools: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Initial Tasks: 
  - Data cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualization of charging demand by hour and day

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle
- Columns: timestamp, station_id, sessions, kWh_delivered

## Objective

To understand peak hours and patterns of EV usage to help with infrastructure planning.
